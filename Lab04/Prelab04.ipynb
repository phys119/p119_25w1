    "**To be clear, for your actual lab, you should still calculate the mean and standard deviation of your data using the built-in Numpy functions ```np.mean()``` and ```np.std()```.**  However, as you will see here, you can also do so without these built-in functions. While it does require several steps of calculations, we want to give you the opportunity to learn how to do it in this \"long way\" since:\n",

    "1. Practicing and maintaining your coding skills is useful beyond just this lab course \n",
    "2. Many of the calculations we perform later in this course will not correspond to built-in functions, so it is useful to learn how to do more complicated calculations.\n",
    "3. Breaking down complicated calculations into a several lines of code---as we do in these \"long way\" calculations---is the strategy that we will be encouraging you to use for most of your coding work going forward in this course. It is often easier to find problems or errors in your calculations if you can look at intermediate steps and values.\n",
